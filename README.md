# Physics Simulator Project

## Purpose of this project
###### This project was started as a way to practice mathematical modeling and visualizations with Python code. 

## Goals for this project
###### Ultimately, I would love to flesh this simulator out with a bunch of features and visualizations. However, this would amount to re-inventing the wheel in a lot of ways. So my actual goal for this is to understand the basics of modeling and visualizations, build my coding skills and add to a portfolio of other projects I am working on. 
###### I will focus on these main objectives:
- simulate simple 2d phyics problems
- learn visualization tools
- simulate particles

###### As this is a learning exercise for me. While satisfying the main objectives, I will be focusing on"
- solving problems programatically
- creating well-styled code
- creating re-usable code
